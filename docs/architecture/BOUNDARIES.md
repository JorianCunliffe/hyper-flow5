# Application boundaries and authority — Phase 01

Contract version: email authority 1.1. Memory remains in Communications Service.

| Authoritative owner | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| Communications Service | Canonical people/identities, cross-channel threads, providers, mailbox credentials/drafts, transcripts, existing memory/extraction/search/enrichment, delivery receipts and persisted account email authority |
| HyperFlow | Organization membership and project access, delegation and business approval, Asks, captured work and confirmed work intents, accepted operational commitments, workflow/run transitions, schedules, reporting and product UI |

Services exchange scoped REST requests and signed canonical events. Neither accesses the other's database. HyperFlow displays Communications context without creating a competing contact, thread or memory authority. Explicit thread/Ask bindings take precedence over inferred similarity. An extracted promise, delivery receipt or phone outcome is evidence; it does not itself approve a workflow or prove a business commitment fulfilled. Calendar context remains in Communications; booking decisions and business integration actions remain in HyperFlow.

## Account email authority

Every organization can select `draft_only` or `allow_send`. This is an organization/account setting, not a hard-coded CEO exception or an individual mailbox setting. Unconfigured accounts default to draft-only. HyperFlow Settings exposes the option; verified organization owners/admins may save it, members may read it. The CEO's first organization therefore starts draft-only without having to guess its ID.

Communications stores the selection in existing `tenants.metadata.email_send_policy`, with an opaque `email_policy_version`. No new service or schema migration is needed. HyperFlow accesses this through REST, not Firebase duplication. GET returns `{mode, configuredMode, version}`; POST accepts `{mode, version}`. Compare-and-swap against the previous metadata prevents lost updates; stale writes return 409 and require reload. Unrelated metadata is preserved.

The optional backend `EMAIL_SEND_POLICY_BY_TENANT` JSON map remains an operator override: exact tenant values are `draft_only` or `allow_send`. A draft-only restriction in either the saved setting or either backend wins. An explicit operator allow can initialize an account's authority but cannot broaden a saved draft-only setting. Unset maps default to `{}`; malformed configuration fails closed with 503. UI shows both selected and effective modes so an operator ceiling is visible.

HyperFlow reads the authoritative policy before outgoing email. Communications checks at the HTTP send handler and immediately before provider dispatch. Policy denial returns 403 with actionable draft-only text. Send-only actions/Ask deliveries fail explicitly; they do not claim delivery or silently become drafts. Existing mailbox draft paths remain available. Policy changes govern subsequent checks; they cannot recall a provider request already in flight.

`allow_send` grants no new project access or workflow approval. Existing recipient, purpose, capability, review and idempotency checks still apply. SMS and phone grants remain separate. The existing automatic reply policy also remains separate from this account email ceiling.

## Authentication and API

- HyperFlow GET/POST `/api/communications/email-policy` uses verified Firebase organization membership. Writes require owner/admin. Body-supplied organization IDs, approval and policy claims confer no additional authority.
- Communications GET/POST `/v1/tenant-policy/email` uses authenticated tenant scope. Reads require `communications:read`; writes require `communications:write` plus `tenant:policy:manage`. These are service-client grants; HyperFlow separately checks the human role. Legacy wildcard access remains single-tenant.
- POST `/v1/messages` additionally requires `sms:send`; POST `/v1/calls` additionally requires `voice:call`; POST `/v1/emails` requires `email:send`. Draft creation uses `email:draft`. Wildcard clients remain subject to saved email authority.
- Direct HyperFlow task and email requests verify the project belongs to the authenticated organization. Existing person/project grants and private voice-context guards remain in force. Tenant-wide `communications:read` is not a project-scoped end-user grant; the P03 context audit must close remaining read-surface gaps before expansion.
- Shared canonical event fixtures remain owned by Communications; HyperFlow consumes them. Keep shared fixtures semantically identical. Prefer additive fields; breaking changes require a versioned fixture and consumer verification in both repositories. The Phase 01 OpenAPI files supplement the existing full API references.

## Release and recovery

This branch starts from current remote main, preserving newer Communications `end_call` support and HyperFlow acceptance documentation. Unpublished ranked-threading/Register work remains in the original checkouts for Phase 02.

Deploy Communications first, then HyperFlow. Existing unconfigured sending accounts will become draft-only: inventory accounts and explicitly retain `allow_send` only where already authorized before rollout. Do not grant wildcard to bypass missing scoped capabilities. Confirm the intended client has policy-management permission before enabling the settings UI.

Missing policy storage/support fails closed. Handle 403 without automatic retry; 409 requires reload; 503 indicates configuration/storage/service availability. Keep Communications enforcement during HyperFlow rollback. Reconcile uncertain provider receipts before retrying an accepted operation. Local fixtures prove contracts and enforcement paths, not production configuration or provider delivery.

## Ambient work ownership and authority

Ambient captures are canonical HyperFlow business-intent records, stored under `captured_work_items/{orgId}/{userId}/{captureId}`. Communications remains authoritative for the source communication, thread, identity and transcript. A capture retains source references; it does not establish another communications-memory store.

The capture lifecycle is independent of FlowRun completion. Run review state contains the bounded selection, current Ask and clarification draft; the durable register retains unresolved items across run resets and interruptions. Capture itself does not advance, redirect or mutate the source run. Source-run provenance is retrieved from the register rather than appended to shared run state.

The capture API derives tenant/user scope from authentication. A review-node owner must be an organization member; review Asks follow existing project access and capability-token rules. This distinction matters: a user-private API queue is not a promise that a selected item's contents remain private after they are placed into a shared project's review Ask.

Suggestions and confidence never authorize effects. Confirmation writes a stable work intent and its resolution link in the same record; `executionStatus: not_executed` explicitly separates confirmation from execution. Calendar, message and reminder effects remain subject to their existing downstream primitives and policies. Captures are also distinct from accepted operational commitments: an unfinished thought is not automatically a promise.

See the [API contract](../API.md#captured-work-items) and [implementation boundaries](../AMBIENT_WORK_CAPTURE_IMPLEMENTATION.md#deliberate-mvp-boundaries). Communications owns phone-tool registration and signs capture requests; HyperFlow verifies the primary owner and source communication before writing the capture store. Automatic cross-channel review remains separate.
